## Fish capture

Since initiation of fieldwork in summer 2021:

-   We have conducted a total of `r n_events` sampling events at `r n_sites_total` unique sites. See the project map in the Methods section ("[Site selection](##%20Site%20selection)") for a current summary of where and when sampling events have occurred.

    -   Table \@ref(tab:site-visits) summarises total samping events by individual site. We typically sampled a site only one time each in summer 2021, with the exception of two sites: "Lower Soldotna Creek", and "Soldotna Creek Parcel." Both of these sites are highlighted in further detail in the "Discussion" section.

-   We have captured `r fish_ct` fish comprised of `r spp_ct` unique species. Table \@ref(tab:ct) summarizes current fish capture count by species.

-   Table \@ref(tab:site-spp-ct) summarizes total fish capture for each species by site.

```{r, site-visits, echo = F, fig.cap = "cap"}
n_sites %>%
  kbl(caption = "Total site visits") %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria",

## Anadromous habitat

```{r, echo = F}

# total new stream kilometers
new_stream_km <- 0.46

# total new lake hectares

```

Fish capture data and supporting documentation will be submitted to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game by mid-December 2021. Sites where anadromous fish have not previously been documented may be considered for addition to the Anadromous Waters Catalog. Pending acceptance of these data, the current estimate for total new stream kilometers that will be added to the AWC in 2021 is `r new_stream_km` km. See the [Discussion](#Discussion) section for further details on factors influencing yearly totals.
